    <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Batteries contain toxic chemicals like mercury, lead, and cadmium, which can leak into the soil and water, causing long-term damage to ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Hazards:</strong> If batteries are thrown away in regular trash or recycled improperly, they can short-circuit or catch fire, leading to dangerous situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Leaked chemicals from batteries can contaminate water supplies, affecting plants, animals, and humans.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the proper methods for disposing of different types of batteries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Use Batteries:</strong> These can usually be disposed of in regular trash if local regulations allow. However, check with your local waste management facility for guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Rechargeable Batteries:</strong> These should never be thrown away in the trash. Instead, take them to a recycling center or a store that offers battery recycling services, like electronics stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Lithium Batteries:</strong> Common in electronics and electric vehicles, these require special handling. Find local battery drop-off sites or recycling programs dedicated to lithium-ion battery disposal.</li>
        <li><strong>Car Batteries:</strong> These should always be recycled at an auto parts store, as they contain hazardous materials that can harm the environment.</li>
    </ul>
