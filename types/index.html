<section>
    <h2>Single-Use Batteries</h2>
    <img src="../files/images/single-use_batteries.jpg" alt="Single-Use Batteries" class="float-left" width="300" height="300"> <!-- Image with float -->
    <p>A single-use battery, also known as a primary battery, is designed for one-time use and cannot be recharged.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resources/Materials:</strong> The anode is often made from zinc, while the cathode is commonly composed of manganese dioxide. The battery casing is typically made of steel, and electrolytes like potassium hydroxide or ammonium chloride.</li>
        <li><strong>Uses of Single-Use:</strong> Remote controls, flashlights, toys, clocks, hearing aids, and smoke detectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Effectiveness:</strong> Typically cost-effective for devices that require low to moderate power over short periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Single-use batteries can have a significant environmental impact if not disposed of properly. They contain hazardous materials like heavy metals and chemicals that can leak into the environment, polluting soil and water.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Rechargeable Batteries</h2>
    <img src="../files/images/rechargeable_batteries.jpg" alt="Rechargeable Batteries" width="300" height="320"> <!-- Image after heading -->
    <p>Rechargeable batteries are designed for multiple uses, as they can be recharged after depletion.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resources/Materials:</strong> The anode of rechargeable batteries is typically made from graphite, while the cathode is often composed of cobalt or manganese. The battery casing is generally made from steel, and the electrolyte consists of lithium salts or nickel compounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Uses of Rechargeables:</strong> Smartphones, laptops, tablets, electric vehicles, cameras, and power tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Effectiveness:</strong> Rechargeable batteries are more cost-effective over time compared to single-use batteries because they can be reused hundreds or thousands of times. Though they have a higher upfront cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Rechargeable batteries have a lower environmental impact compared to single-use batteries, as they can be reused multiple times, reducing waste. However, their production and disposal can still cause environmental harm.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
   <h2>Car Batteries</h2>
    <img src="../files/images/car_batteries.jpg" alt="Car Batteries" width="300" height="300"> <!-- Image after heading -->
    <p>Car batteries, typically lead-acid, provide the power needed to start a vehicle and operate its electrical systems.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resources/Materials:</strong> The anode in a car battery is made from lead, while the cathode is composed of lead dioxide. The battery casing is typically made of plastic, and the electrolyte consists of a sulfuric acid solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Uses of Car Batteries:</strong>  The car, lights, radio, and air conditioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Effectiveness:</strong> Car batteries are cost-effective in the long run as they are durable and last several years. While they require a higher initial investment compared to other power sources, their longevity and ability to be recharged make them more economical over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Car batteries have significant environmental impacts if not disposed of properly. Lead and sulfuric acid are hazardous materials that can contaminate soil and water.</li>
    </ul>
